## About

In this project from TripleTen Web Developer Bootcamp. It was asked to refactor the previous ["Around the USA"](https://edu-fortes.github.io/web_project_4_ptbr/) page, that was coded using vanilla JS, to React.

To do this, all the HTML markup was ported to JSX, moving each section into a new React component.

Some interactives are present, when clicking on the buttons to change the avatar, edit the profile and add a new location, a pop-up window with a form is displayed so that the user can enter new inputs.

Not all of the interactive is working yet. But since this is an introduction to the React module, in the near future everything will work accordingly.

To obtain this interactivity, "useState" and "useEffect" were used. And a declarative approach with "props".

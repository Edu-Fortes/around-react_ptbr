## About

In this project from TripleTen Web Developer Bootcamp. It was asked to refactor the previous ["Around the USA"](https://edu-fortes.github.io/web_project_4_ptbr/) page, that was coded using vanilla JS, to React.

To do this, all the HTML markup was ported to JSX, moving each section into a new React component.

Some interactives are present, when clicking on the buttons to change the avatar, edit the profile and add a new location, a pop-up window with a form is displayed so that the user can enter new inputs.

Every server request is made through an API.

To obtain this interactivity, "useState" and "useEffect" were used. And a declarative approach with "props".
